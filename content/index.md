I'm a constantly improving data scientist wanting to share my data journey with you. I built this site so people like you can access my projects portfolio in a very accessible manner.

Let me tell you more about what you will find on this site:

## [ My data science portfolio](/blog/)

On this page you will find many data related projects i've done out of personal interest. Some of them might more or less appealing to you depending on the subject and the project's complexity.

Feel free to dive in and look around, i'm sure you'll find something useful. Plus, you can see all the code i wrote for each project!

## [My Resume](/resume/) 

Well... it's all the boring stuff: education, work experience, skills, etc...

## [My Data Science Certificates](/certificates/)

This is just me showing off all those hard-earned data science certificates.
